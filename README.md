# Create your own dynamic, fake REST API

We were in need for some mock data for our project. Like literally, some copy-pasta JSON file would have done the job, but you know how it is 🤷‍♂️ Fast forward a few hours and yes, I **really** had to make it a REST API, give it some interface, allow for both static and dynamic data creation, host it.. I mean, I had no choice, right? 🙃

Anyway, luckily it didn't take me too long to do this. And the main reason for that is that I was able to use the amazing tools other people already created. In case you are interested in replicating this or build something similar, well, feel free to use this as a template, clone, fork, or whatever you want to do.
